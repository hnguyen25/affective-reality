# Affective Reality

Affective reality is a [Stanford BCI](https://stanfordbci.com) project which seeks to use biometric data to recognize one's emotional and focused state, and then use this to inform a virtual reality environment--whether that be a meditation app whose environment and soundscape changes depending on mood and relaxation, or an education app that monitors focus to increase learning outcomes. The end goal is to create a closed loop, bi-directional system wherein one's mental states influences the VR environment, and conversely, the VR environment influences one's mental state.
